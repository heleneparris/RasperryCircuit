# RasperryCircuit

This project is a custom designed printed circuit board that uses 30 NeoPixels, an ATTiny85, a push button, and a micro USB port to create light displays. 

Part of this project included creating multi-dimesional arrays to store color values and animation frames to conserve memory on the ATTiny85. 

There are 3 modes: 
1. Off
2. A 2-Frame Animation
3. A Red to Blue color fade
